The collection centre, or designee, performs the medical work-up of the volunteer donor and provides the final approval of the volunteer donor for collection. The collection centre packages the donation for transport to the transplant centre.</li>\n\t<li>Product - A cellular therapy product that contains haematopoietic stem cells and/or other nucleated cells intended for therapeutic use.</li>\n\t<li>Product code - Unique numeric or alphanumeric identifier by which it will be possible to trace any cellular therapy product to its donor and to all records describing the handling and final disposition of the product.</li>\n\t<li>CVC - Central venous catheter. A catheter placed in a vein in the neck (internal jugular vein), chest (subclavian or axillary vein) or in the groin (femoral vein).</li>\n\t<li>SAE - Serious adverse event. Any untoward occurrence associated with the procurement, testing, processing, storage, and distribution of tissues and cells that might lead to the transmission of an infectious disease, to death or life-threatening, disabling or incapacitating conditions for patients or which might result in, or prolong, hospitalisation or morbidity.</li>\n\t<li>SAR - Serious adverse reaction. An unintended response, including a communicable disease, in the donor or in the recipient associated with the procurement or human application of tissues and cells that is fatal, life-threatening, disabling, incapacitating or which results in, or prolongs, hospitalisation or morbidity.</li>\n\t<li>S(P)EAR - A centralised international database recording written description of SAE and SAR that has or may have resulted in harm to an unrelated donor or that impact the quality of a donated cellular product that have or may have resulted in harm to a recipient. The database also includes the outcome of any investigation to determine the cause of the event.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>WMDA Standard:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>1.08 If a registry relies on an independent collection centre for the collection of donor HSC or other donor cellular products, for donor medical evaluation or for the follow-up of donors, the registry must ensure that the collection centre complies with WMDA Standards in these areas. The nature of these affiliations and the duties and responsibilities of each entity must be documented in a written agreement.</li>\n\t<li>8.01 Collection of HSC and any other collected cell products intended for therapeutic use, must be performed at a collection centre/cord blood collection site that fulfils standards established by the government or prevailing in the relevant community for such a facility.</li>\n\t<li>8.02 The collection centre/cord blood collection site must ensure the identity, safety and privacy of the donor and the confidentiality of the donor and cord blood data.</li>\n\t<li>8.03 The collection centre/cord blood bank collection site and the collection of HSC or other donor cellular product must be under the direction of trained and experienced health care professionals.</li>\n\t<li>8.04 If required, autologous donor blood must be collected at a blood collection centre that fulfils national and/or regional and/or international guidelines for such a facility.</li>\n\t<li>8.05 If a volunteer donor is subjected to a medical intervention as part of the HSC or cellular product collection process, the registry must have appropriate policies and procedures to protect the health and safety of the donor and of the recipient.</li>\n\t<li>8.05.1 These policies should include the procedure regarding the type of collection (HSC, apheresis versus HSC, Marrow) in case of failed mobilisation.</li>\n\t<li>8.05.2 The registry must have a policy concerning the use of CVC in volunteer donors to assure that a CVC is only used in exceptional circumstances. Those circumstances must be documented.</li>\n\t<li>8.05.3 The registry must have a policy that protects the safety of the volunteer donors with a CVC inserted.</li>\n\t<li>8.06 Written policies and procedures must be in place to ensure the identity, quality and quantity of the collected cells. These must include policies for communication between the transplant centre, collection centre/cord blood bank and cell-processing unit regarding the number of cells required.</li>\n\t<li>8.07 Written documentation of the characteristics of the collected product important in facilitating transplantation must be provided with the cells according to applicable guidelines. The documentation and/or label, at a minimum, must include information on the name of the product and product code, the number of cells collected, the donor&rsquo;s unique identifier, donor ABO/Rh group, identification of the patient, date and time of collection (only in case of volunteer donors), any processing details, and name and contact information of the transplant centre.</li>\n\t<li>8.07.1 The registry should utilise an international coding and labeling system for the product to ensure the identity of the product.</li>\n\t<li>8.09 SAE affecting a cellular product intended for a specific patient must be identified, documented, investigated and remedial and/or corrective action taken.</li>\n\t<li>8.10 SAR impacting the cellular product and hence potentially the patient&rsquo;s health must be submitted to a WMDA international centralised database of such events (S(P)EAR).</li>\n\t<li>8.10.1 Reports of SAR affecting the donated cellular product must be communicated to the registry involved in the donation if the event might affect the transplantation. Other individuals or groups should be notified as appropriate.</li>\n\t<li>8.10.2 The registry must comply with governmental regulations including requirements to report such adverse reactions to a regulatory agency.</li>\n</ul>\n"
